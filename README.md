# Willfreight Express Cargo Services Limited (WEC) Company Website

## Live Link
The project is still in development but as soon as it goes live a link to the deployed site will be provided. The current website, which is being phased out, can be found [here](https://www.willfreight.com/).

## About the project
This project is an attempt to revamp and replace the currently existing company website which can be found [here](https://www.willfreight.com/). 

The current website has a lot of features; this project attempts to trim down any unncessary features in order to deliver a clean, minimal and functional website that increases customer satisfaction and drives more engagement and sale for the company.

The React code for the web application -- that interacts with a REST API backend -- can be found within this repository.

## Technologies used
The technology stack used for this project is as follows:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the development
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for the client side routing
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling the React components
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for the mockups and designs
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) for handling form validation within React

## Setup (for any devs who want to contribute to this project)
First, fork the repository using your Github account.

Once you have forked the repository, you can clone the code directly onto your local machine using the `git clone` command.

On your machine, in the project directory, you can run `npm install`.

This will install all of the node module dependencies needed to run the application. 

The terminal may prompt you to run `npm audit fix`. I recommend you run `npm audit fix --force` to get rid of any errors.

You can then run `npm start` which runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Your change will be reviewed and approved or commented on in due course once all the steps above are followed.
